Currently, I am a Software Developer at Jarvis Consulting Group, where I have worked on multiple projects in Java, Linux, SQL, and Docker. Throughout my career history, I've worked in numerous fast-paced and collaborative groups, where to be successful, I always had to learn new things, and also always be dependable to build trust with various stakeholders.
