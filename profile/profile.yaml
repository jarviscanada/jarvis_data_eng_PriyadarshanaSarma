summary: I am a recent graduate from Humber College with a degree in Information Technology Solutions, concentrated in Java, REST APIs, and SQL. I have also worked as a Software Engineer at TPF Software India Pvt Ltd, performing various tasks in SDLC such as requirements gathering, component designing (APIs, data model), software implementation (Java and SQL), and testing implemented solutions. Currently, I am a Software Developer at Jarvis Consulting Group, where I have worked on multiple projects in Java, SpringBoot, Linux, SQL, and Docker. Throughout my career history, I've worked in numerous fast-paced and collaborative groups, where to be successful, I always had to learn new things, and also always be dependable to build trust with various stakeholders. I like to follow a loop of improving my skills, being more effective, and contributing more value to my role. I look forward to continuing my journey as a Software Developer.
